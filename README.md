# ombiel-ical-generator

### Introduction ###

Simple Python script that generates Ombiel campusm timetable data __(in XML)__ into an icalendar format. Initially, this was an experiment to directly get timetable data from campusm without using the university app itself. This script was tested on the iHull app by the University of Hull and may also work on other campusm based apps made by ombiel.

More to be documented soon...
