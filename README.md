# ombiel-ical-generator

### Introduction ###

Simple Python script that generates Ombiel campusm timetable data __(in XML)__ into an icalendar format (iCal). Initially, this was just a small experiment to directly get my personal timetable data from campusm without using the university app itself. This script was tested on the iHull app which was created for the University of Hull. This script can be also altered to work on other campusm based apps made by Ombiel.



### Requirements ###
To run this script you must have to following:

* Python 2.7+
* requests
* icalendar

1.  First, install the Python packages:

    `sudo pip install requests icalendar`

2. Run **python ombiel_service_to_ical.py** in the terminal to generate the ical for your timetable.
